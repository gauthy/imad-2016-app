          <p class="about-me">
 I have enrolled on this course on august ending after seeing it on nptel website.I was very much interested to 
 take this course from the beginning .Once the course has started I was following every week regularly .I liked 
 the way course has been organised by IMAD team.
 
 <br><br>
  One of the best thing about this course you don't need any tools required for working on practicals .You can directly work 
  cloud console provided by the IMAD team.Even a person who just knows little computer basics and having interest to learn
  can take this course.It has been organised in such a way.I have learnt really a lot of things from practicals and assignments.
   <br><br>
 Finally ,for final project i have developed web app which is blog+personal profile. I also developed another app apart from 
 this project is portfolio app which includes about my projects and my self .I would personally like to thank tanmay gopal sir 
 for making this course so interesting and challenging.
